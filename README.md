# README

### This is my Computer Languages and Representations coursework that I did as part of my second year doing Computer Science at the University of Exeter. The four files attached are code to various challenges written in Haskell and Prolog.

## Getting Started
To run the Haskell code, navigate to the link below:
```html
https://replit.com/languages/haskell
```
Sign-up or login if you have an account. Then, copy the contents of the Haskell file that you wish to run and paste into a Haskell file within a repl. Once pasted, click the ```Run``` button situated on the top of the page and the code will be executed.

To run the Prolog code, navigate to the link below:
```html
https://swish.swi-prolog.org/
```
A prompt on the left-side of the page will ask you to "Create a Program/Notebook here". Click the ```Program``` button, then copy the contents of the Prolog file that you wish to run and paste within the left-side of the page. Once pasted, click ```Run!``` on the bottom-right corner of the page and the code will be executed.
